You've scanned a code  
In an abode  
That cannot be simply missed  
If it's pizza you seek  
And maybe a stiff drink  
Then read on and don't fall to the winds.  

On Thursday Night  
You won't have a fright  
If you show up to The Skip on a whim  
At Nine PM or so  
If you know, you know  
It's a secret, so do tell your friends.    

Want to show up?  
You don't need to rush  
But we would like an accurate count.  
Open up the bird site  
And tweet into the night  
"#DetroitSRECity", my friend.  

(Thanks for playing!)
